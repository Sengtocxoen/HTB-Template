# Penetration Testing Framework

A comprehensive penetration testing framework that automates and organizes the penetration testing workflow. This framework is designed to help security professionals conduct thorough penetration tests while maintaining proper documentation and reporting.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Organized into distinct stages for better maintainability and extensibility
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Covers all major aspects of penetration testing
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates both technical and executive reports
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Windows and Linux systems
- **Tool Integration**: Integrates with popular penetration testing tools

## Stages

1. **Information Gathering**
   - Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
   - Infrastructure Enumeration
   - Service Enumeration
   - Host Enumeration

2. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - CVE Analysis
   - Exploit Research
   - Vulnerability Scanning
   - Diagnostic Analysis

3. **Exploitation**
   - Exploit Suggestions
   - POC Research
   - Exploitation Attempts
   - Success Documentation

4. **Post-Exploitation**
   - System Information Gathering
   - User Information Gathering
   - Network Information Gathering
   - Privilege Escalation
   - Data Exfiltration
   - Persistence

5. **Lateral Movement**
   - Pivoting
   - Evasive Testing
   - Network Discovery
   - Service Enumeration
   - User Enumeration
   - Vulnerability Assessment
   - Exploitation
   - Post-Exploitation
